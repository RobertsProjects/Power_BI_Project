# Power_BI_Project
Analyzing Loan Risk and Key Financial Metrics

This Power BI project analyzes a loan default dataset using interactive dashboards across three pages. 
I imported and modeled the data using SQL Server and Power BI Dataflows, then applied DAX functions such as CALCULATE, SUMX, ALLEXCEPT, MEDIANX, and SWITCH to derive key insights. 
The dashboards visualize loan distribution by purpose, employment type, credit score, and age group, including year-over-year (YoY) and year-to-date (YTD) metrics. 
I implemented data validation, decomposition trees, and automated data refresh through scheduled and incremental updates in Power BI Service.
